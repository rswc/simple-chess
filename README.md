# Chess application

This repository contains an implementation of the famous game Chess, beloved by millions around the globe, intended for two players on the same machine.
In the interest of simplicity, special moves, such as castling and en passant were cut from this version, and the winstate is triggered by one player's capture of the enemy king piece.
